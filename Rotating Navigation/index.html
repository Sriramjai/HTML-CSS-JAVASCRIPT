            <p>The Australian Cattle Dog is an extremely intelligent, active, and sturdy dog breed. Developed by Australian settlers to handle herds of cattle on expansive ranches, they’re still used today as a herding dog. They thrive on having a job to do and on being part of all family activities.

            Australian Cattle Dogs are loyal and protective of their families, though wary of outsiders. Besides herding work, they do well at canine sports, including agility, obedience, rally, flyball, and flying disc competitions. Novice pet parents and apartment dwellers beware; these dogs need a lot — a lot! — of mental and physical activity to stay happy and healthy, and to prevent bored, destructive behavior. If you have a home with plenty of room to run, and you can keep up with such an active pup, this may be the breed for you!

            <p>The Australian Cattle Dog is a high-energy working dog. He is not a couch potato — we repeat: he is not a couch potato. He wants to be active and busy most of the time. His energy must be directed, or he'll become bored and will resort to entertaining himself, usually by doing something you consider naughty, like digging in the trash or digging up your flower garden.

            The Australian Cattle Dog is also highly devoted to his owner and family. He usually attaches himself closely to one person and bonds less closely with others. He's often called a "Velcro" dog because he attaches so firmly; he likes to be in close physical contact with his chosen person all the time.</p>
